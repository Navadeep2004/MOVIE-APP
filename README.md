Here I have used React function components to build header and movie titles rows. I used TMDB API to get the requests related to movies.
Website Overview
1) Below is a picture of the website when we first open it on a browser.

2)You can search for movies on the search bar of the website and a shortcut (CTRL+K) is also implemented.

3) Movie trailers for respective movies are also fetched and we can see them by clicking on the movie card and the website will automatically scroll down to the movie trailer.

4)we can stop the video by clicking on any movie card or the "close video" button below the movie trailer.

5)MOVIE-APP, search bar, and title are made to be fixed at the top.
